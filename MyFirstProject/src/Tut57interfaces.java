/*An interface is a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods.
Some specifications for interfaces:
- Defined using the interface keyword.
- May contain only static final variables.
- Cannot contain a constructor because interfaces cannot be instantiated.
- Interfaces can extend other interfaces.
- A class can implement any number of interfaces.

Interfaces have the following properties:
- An interface is implicitly abstract. You do not need to use the abstract keyword while declaring an interface.
- Each method in an interface is also implicitly abstract, so the abstract keyword is not needed.
- Methods in an interface are implicitly public.
A class can inherit from just one superclass, but can implement multiple interfaces!*/
