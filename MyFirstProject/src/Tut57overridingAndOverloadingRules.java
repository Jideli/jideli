/* Overloading: When methods have the same name, but different parameters, 
it is known as method overloading. This can be very useful when you need the same method
functionality for different types of parameters.
An overloaded method must have a different argument list; the parameters should differ
in their type, number, or both. Another name for method overloading is compile-time polymorphism.*/


/*Rules for Method Overriding:
- Should have the same return type and arguments
- The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method's access level 
(Example: If the superclass method is declared public, the overriding method in the 
sub class can be neither private nor protected)
- A method declared final or static cannot be overridden
- If a method cannot be inherited, it cannot be overridden
- Constructors cannot be overridden
Method overriding is also known as runtime polymorphism.*/
